# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project is an **entry for the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition**.  
The goal is to predict survival of passengers based on personal information such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

## Project Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
- Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`) using OneHotEncoding.
- Handled missing values and scaled numerical features.
- Trained a **Random Forest model** to predict survival.

## Results
- **Kaggle Score:** 0.78229  
  (Not bad for a first attempt!)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
